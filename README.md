# Deadline Collision Detector

Deadline Collision Detector is a student task planner that helps track assignments, exams, labs, and vivas while highlighting deadline collisions. The app combines a React + Vite frontend with an Express + MySQL backend and Clerk-based authentication.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete tasks.
- Organize work by subject and category.
- Detect deadline collisions between tasks.
- Sync authenticated users through Clerk.
- View a dashboard with task statistics and alerts.
- Toggle between light and dark themes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Motion, Lucide React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Authentication:** Clerk

## Project Structure

- `src/` contains the React UI, pages, components, and shared types.
- `server.ts` starts the Express server and mounts the API routes.
- `routes/`, `controllers/`, `models/`, and `config/` contain the backend MVC layers.
- `schema.sql` includes the database schema and sample seed data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- MySQL 8 or compatible
- A Clerk application if you want authentication enabled

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and configure your database credentials:

   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=deadline_db
   ```

3. Create the database schema:

   ```sql
   source schema.sql
   ```

   The server also creates the required tables automatically when it connects to MySQL, but the schema file is useful for first-time setup and sample data.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open the app in your browser at:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the Express server and Vite middleware in development |
| `npm run build` | Builds the frontend for production |
| `npm run preview` | Previews the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Runs TypeScript type checking |
| `npm run clean` | Removes the `dist/` directory |

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Returns a basic health check |
| `GET` | `/api/tasks` | Lists tasks |
| `POST` | `/api/tasks` | Creates a task |
| `PUT` | `/api/tasks/:id` | Updates a task |
| `DELETE` | `/api/tasks/:id` | Deletes a task |
| `GET` | `/api/tasks/detect-clashes` | Returns detected deadline collisions |
| `GET` | `/api/subjects` | Lists subjects |
| `POST` | `/api/subjects` | Creates a subject |
| `DELETE` | `/api/subjects/:id` | Deletes a subject |
| `POST` | `/api/users/sync` | Syncs a Clerk user into the database |

## Database Notes

- The app expects `users`, `subjects`, `tasks`, and `collision_alerts` tables.
- The backend initializes missing tables on startup through the MySQL pool configuration.
- Task collision detection flags tasks whose deadlines are the same or within one day of each other.

## Troubleshooting

- If the UI loads but data does not appear, confirm MySQL is running and the `.env.local` values are correct.
- If authentication fails, verify your Clerk configuration in the frontend environment.
- If ports conflict, ensure nothing else is running on port `3000`.
